# Project 2
This repository is broken down into **2** tasks that make up Project 2.

## Flowcharts
- Flowcharts aid in giving a visual representation.
- Task 1 and Task 2 each have flowcharts.
- Both Flowcharts are PDF's.

## Files
- The other files are **.html** and **.ipynb**
- These files contain the code for Task 1 and Task 2. 

## First Task: Hangman
The first task in this project was to construct a simple hangman code. 
Users have to guess the letters that make up a word. 
The program gives users **10** tries to guess the word. 

## Second Task
The words that appear on thr hangman appear to not make up a word.
However, they are actually encrypted messages.
If the user guesses the word right, the decoded message will appear.
In order to decode the message, the code has to be the opposite values of the encrypted function.
